Eolo is a RESTful app that can accept and manipulate images uploaded by the user. The manipulation is deferred thanks to a queue. Lastly, a feed provides a list of all images available for every user. Eolo embraces twelve factors, cutting-edge performances, and functional programming.

- With ESM module support and `experimental-specifier-resolution=node`
- Full stricted Typescript code
- Fine granular configuration of Eslint, Prettier and Tsc
- Domain Driven Development throught _Decoder_ and _Parsers_

## Tech

Eolo uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [PolkaJS] - A micro web server so fast, it'll make you dance! ðŸ‘¯
- [FP-TS] - Functional programming in TypeScript 
- [IO-TS] - Runtime type system for IO decoding/encoding 
- [Sharp] - High performance Node.js image processing, the fastest module to resize JPEG, PNG, WebP, AVIF and TIFF images. 
- [Node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
- [Redis] - Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker.
- [Pino] - ðŸŒ² super fast, all natural json logger ðŸŒ²

And of course Eolo is itself open source with a [public repository][eolo] on GitHub.

## Installation

Eolo requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v16+ and [Redis] v6.2+ to run. 

Install the Nodejs runtime and Redis following respective documentations. Then...

provide a custom `.env` file, ie:
```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

bootstrap Server with:
```sh
yarn install
LOG_LEVEL=info yarn start

## for production: 
yarn install --production
LOG_LEVEL=info NODE_ENV=production yarn start

```

and start the Worker:
```sh
LOG_LEVEL=info yarn worker

## for production: 
LOG_LEVEL=info  NODE_ENV=production yarn worker
```

In case of errors ie: `ECONNREFUSED`, etc. Please consider to properly tweak the following Env's variables.

## Enviromental variables

What follows is a table of principal variables and some examples

| Env Name | Example |
| ------ | ------ |
| NODE_ENV | `production` |
| LOG_LEVEL | `info`, `warn`, `error` or `debug`, default `silent` |
| PORT | default `3000` |
| REDIS_PREFIX | prefix |
| REDIS_PORT | 6379 |
| REDIS_HOST | 127.0.0.1 |
| REDIS_FAMILY | 4 | 
| REDIS_PASSWORD | "CHANGEME"| 
| REDIS_DB | 0 |
| UPLOADS_FOLDER | "uploads/" |

## Testing

Once dependencies were installed, execute

```sh
yarn test

```

for coverage:

```sh
yarn test:coverage

```

## Docker

Eolo can be executed from a container without any further ado. 
Please take care to properly provide a working `.env` file (for an exaustive list please consider: [Env Variables](https://github.com/nidble/eolo#envriomental-variables) ) and then issue:

```sh
docker-compose up
```
Eventualy adjust write permissions of upload folder.

## Curl Examples
verify that server working is awake with the following command
```sh
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X GET http://localhost:3030/healthz
```

then submit a new image
```sh
curl -F username=pluto -F image=@/home/Users/pluto/32178.jpg http://localhost:3030/api/v1/image
```

or see all user's images
```sh
curl -X GET http://localhost:3030/api/v1/image/pluto/
```

## FE Example
An Html page with a POC is available on `example` folder, to play with it issue:
```sh
cd example
npx static-server
```
